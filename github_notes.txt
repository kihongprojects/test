COLLABORATING ON PROJECTS
---------------------------------------------
1. assuming I'm in control but I want to give access to others to do certain tasks, but I may want to keep things private instead of public
2. profile, top right corner
3. click your repositories
4. Repositories tab 
5. click New 
6. give repository name
7. private
8. click create repository button
9. creating a new file in the Quick setup section 
10. give a name
11. give a note in the Commit New file
12. click commit new file button 
13. now the new person will need a github account
14. need to set them as a collaborator 
15. settings in the tab area, not the settings in the profile
Code   Issues   Pull requests   Actions   Projects   Security   Insights   >>Settings<<
16. manage access 
17. Invite a collaborator button 
18. type in a username, full name or email of the collaborator we want to add
19. select that account
20. click add to this repository
21. the collaborator will receive an invite in their email and can access 
22. the collaborator accepts the invitation and that collaborator is now added into our account as a collaborator to our project
23. the collaborator now has a right to add, make changes, etc and push changes into our repository
24. collaborator creates a new instance folder in VS code
25. git clone url of the page he wants to work on.
26. run to get rid of token:
    for windows users
    git credential reject - enter
    host=github.com - enter
    protocol=https - enter
    enter

    for mac users
    git credential-osxkeychain erase - enter
    host-github.com - enter 
    protocol=https - enter
    enter
27. typically for a collaborator, he should create a new branch instead of working on the main branch
        git checkout -b xxxxxxx
28. assuming they created files, then git add . and git commit -m "some notes"
29. collaborator will go to profile > settings > developer settings > personal access tokens > generate new token > checkboxes > generate token button
30. copy token
31. git push origin main (or newly created branch)
32. log in with credentials...and new token information

33. if the main person adds a new file and pushes, it wont show for the collaborator
34. so the collaborator needs to update by:
    git pull (brings remote to local)


---------------------------------------------
CONTRIBUTION ON PROJECTS - FORKS AND PULL REQUESTS
---------------------------------------------
1. CONTRIBUTION is something you see in open source Projects
2. anyone can access the main code and add, change or fix bugs whereas collaborator may just work on a special feature and not the main code. 
3.
